      When I was about 12 or 13 I had this obsession with dry ice. I loved Halloween and generally
      all things spooky and gothic –– it wasn’t part of my identity or anything, I wasn’t a “goth” at
      school (those kids wouldn’t look at me thrice) but the sensation of scary fun was the first place
      I would go to when I wanted to escape into the realm of fantasy. This included movies,
      sleepovers, slumber parties, in short, of the things I liked it was my favourite. My friends and
      I, it was our thing. We were neither popular nor unpopular, we were “cool” (at least we
      thought ourselves so), we were smart. But our thing was this obsession with the paranormal,
      that’s what distinguished us from the other kids that liked whatever was on their fones or
      fablets or plexicons. This gothic, romantic, spooky temperament was what made us unique.
      It coloured everything we did –– our humour, our silliness, our inherently anti-authoritarian
      intellects. This dorksided inclination had nothing to do with morality. It wasn’t about good
      and evil, per se. It was our secret weapon. We knew instantly what had it and what didn’t, in
      art, music, life, etc. so if our teacher or pastor or president tried to tell us something different
      we instantly knew they were lying, it was effortless to write these supposed learned elders off
      straightaway, and we showed them no respect at all, no deference. It was that simple. Dry
      Ice was part of all that. When I was a kid we could only stream movies on our TV, we didn’t
      have all of the various ways of digesting entertainment that we have today, but looking back
      now at that apparent lack of options it is clear to me that such restraint is a clear advantage.
      There was a certain look movies and shows had when all you had to do was click an app and
      click the show you wanted –– without all of the personal control you have over platforms
      today, which only amounts to having to do so much more work it seems –– the small waxing
      sliver of a thumbnail, a picture and a title only, esp. with horror movies (which I wasn’t
      allowed to watch and therefore could only steal viewings in quick unchronological moments
      when my parents weren’t looking or had gone to sleep) offered stolen glances into worlds that
      were forbidden, that offered just enough to tempt, and terrify. There was one movie in
      particular, called The Threshold that was particularly noteworthy.

      <span id="sec2"></span>
      That one really made an
impression, and has since stuck with me through the ages and eras of my personal history and
growth. Despite new experiences, more knowledge, a higher tolerance for fear, it still
manages to haunt like few other things ever could. I knew it then in my tender and
inexperienced youth that what I was viewing existed in a place outside of our dimension, in a
world of shifting space & time, a realm of heightened awareness and precision. “HD World”
I called it because it was like our world only better, higher definition, higher quality, a battery
charged to 101%. My friends and I had all been there, to this place, although the same things
didn’t always take us there. Still, the knowledge of having walked even for a second in this
thrilling and terrible land bonded us closer together. The trailer for The Threshold consisted
of a man, a creature really, some preternatural banshee or skinwalker, staring malignantly at
the camera, through the camera, at you, the viewer. It was a face of unending terror. How
else can I describe it? It was so unknown, so impossible looking, and its malice so defined and
complete, so unfeeling towards you, so utterly incognizant of the fundamental value of your
existence hat the pure dread I felt upon looking at the face was not merely a fear for my own
personal safety but for my entire consciousness as well. Just looking at it seemed to be enough.
The man could hurt you with just a look, that was all it took. I remember whispering to
myself one night sitting on the couch in the complete dark, the bluish glow of the TV screen
a light from an opening portal, that “I had seen the Devil.” The man with the glowing power
donut and the long hail showers of ice-silver hair hanging about his shoulders in curtains of
gleaming crystal… the freak brighteness of those vivid locks seemed connected to –– one with
–– the gothic fog that hovered about him in thick transparent plumes. This unholy mist
captivated me. It was a signifying attribute of the multidimensional atmosphere where the
Mothman was from (I remember thinking to myself then that in the 4th dimension a wight
doesn’t perceive events in terms of 3D chronology but rather in terms of their emotional
potency) yet it wasn’t the monster itself, it was separate from him, and I found it extremely
enticing to be so close to what I ultimately feared without having to embrace that black
shadow. I mistakenly thought that I could have the mood without its darker inhabitants. If I
could only possess the mist, in order to unleash it in my own safe environs, for myself only,
then the energizing effects of the proximity to such a powerful force would be mine also. I
was yet to learn how its effect was created –– the dry ice, that is. The brother of a friend of
mine explained it to me one day. He worked one summer as an apprentice to a technical crew
working on a low budget horror movie, The Long Interstate, I think it was, a cool movie,
although for my friend’s brother the subject of the movie never mattered, he only considered
its technical aspects from the viewpoint of mes-en-scene, he cared nothing for subject matter.
